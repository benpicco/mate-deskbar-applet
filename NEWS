======================
deskbar-applet 2.13.92
======================

Changes:
	* Fixes bug #332418, now we use Icons instead of buttons in the panel reducing the needed panel vertical space
	* Don't import beagle each time we need it. Only when loading the module. This wastly increases beagle-live performance.
	* Fixes the applet not remembering 'take all available space on panel' setting on startup
	* API change: removed the 'max' argument to the Handler.query() method. The handlers can now return any number of mathes or use the hardwired deskbar.DEFAULT_RESULTS_PER_HANDLER variable to trim the results. Fixes bug #331884
	* Fix bug #332080, empty history borking completion UI
	* Really fix duplicate module loading Return URIS in file and folder handler to correctly detect duplicates
	* Add a 'No History' item in the history dropdown when there is no history.
	* Implement single-click selection for history and cuemiac dropdown.
	* Add focus-follow-pointer for history dropdown
	* Add a "Clear History" button in the applet menu
	* Fix wrong exception raising in C code of set_process_name for people who don't have prctl

======================
deskbar-applet 2.13.90
======================

Note: For some unknown reasons, it is not possible to focus the new UI with the
keybinding in gnome 2.12's panel. Help is appreciated.

Changes:
	* Bump to 2.13.90 to match gnome version 
	* Default to completion UI
	* Change keyboard shortcuts triggering terminal or smart bookmarks to use Alt instead of Ctrl.
	* beagle-live tries to use text snippets when available
	* Categories are sorted according to the highest handler priority (as defined in the preferences) found in a match within the category. Matches insides a category are sorted according to their handler preference then relative priority. Finally alphabetic order is used.
	* Remember collapsed categories in the cuemiac UI	
	* Add proxy detection code in google-live
	* More stock icons, so we get theming
	* New Artwork
	* History handler, previously hardcoded is now a regular handler (old commands appear as matches)
	* Add a GTK exception handler dialog for easier debug
	* Middle click on the cuemiac view to trigger a search with middle-click clipboard content
	* Add an ui override for window mode: -wc for cuemiac, -w for completion ui
	* Fix the indexer to return more matches
	* New preferences UI with both completion and cuemic.
	* OMG ! The CUEMIAC ! Merci Mikkel Kamstrup Erlandsen <kamstrup@daimi.au.dk> !
	* Implement Serialization for matches, allows to speedup startup time, and not block on startup
	  when a handler is blocking.
	* API changes for the handlers, API is near-final.

====================
deskbar-applet 0.8.6
====================

Changes:
	* Remove our own beagle python binding. This mean we require beagle 0.1.3 that ships with python bindings.
	* New tango-ish artwork (because we're hype)
	* Fix history behavior. Duplicate items in history are moved instead of being added multiple times. Fixes bug #322981: Duplicate items in history
	* Builtin history completion as a regular match. 
	* Web search bookmarks (aka "smart bookmarks") can now have shortcuts (aka "keywords") and keyboard shortcuts.
	* Tidied up the preferences dialog. 
	* Disabled handlers are now sorted by name alphabetically in the Preferences UI.
	* Scale down those icons that are too large.
	* Evolution handler is now sync rather than async. This will hopefully fix evolution handler bugs like bug #322119.
	* Fixed crasher when user has more than one address book available for auto-completion. Possibly fixes bug #321975.
	* 'Smart' history browsing, now it's possible to use shell-like up/down key to browse history, yet preserving (page) up/down navigation in the matches list.

====================
Deskbar Applet 0.8.1 -- The eye of Sauron is moving
====================

Changes:
	* Some more beagle fixes, and release 0.8.1
	* More beagle properties fixtures
	* Fix the sender of the mails being None all the time
	* Fix for bug #319549 gnome.ui segfault on certain filenames.

	* Fix implicit http addresses parsing

Contributors to this release: Raphael Slinckx, Nigel Tao, Mikkel Kamstrup

====================
Deskbar Applet 0.8.0 --  No, it's not /written/ in C!
====================

Changes:
	* Improve the regexes for mail and location detection. It is now possible to have user@host but with the method specified, otherwise it's an email address. Add package config file to allow third parties to install handlers in the right place.
	* Add gnomevfs monitoring for module loader. That means drag and dropped handlers in the user or system handlers directory will be loaded, and automagically show in the prefs dialog, unenabled by default. We do not do anything on modification, because it would only be useful for developpers, and then developpers don't want handlers to autoupdate.
	* Add gnomevfs file monitoring to handlers that need it. Epiphany, Galeon, mozilla now reload on bookmark, history, search engines addition/removal. The gtkBookmarks are also reloaded when needed. Other handlers do not need this functionality
	* Speed-up the loading of the module by not loading the list of executables. Executables are instead "probed" at each query. Side effect, is that we don't need to reindex the $PATH when a new program is installed
	* Fix the previous fix to pass distcheck. Allow to use a development deskbar-applet with its own set of enabled handlers and priority, to not interfere with stable one. (Useful only for developpers)
	* Change the location of deskbar-applet launcher script, using /usr/libexec is deprecated. Fixes bug #319354
	* Cleanup the way we use icons. Whenever possible, use stock icons, removed duplicate icons we shipped in the tarball.
	* Add libbeagle python binding, and the associated beagle-live.py handler allowing to search with beagle from within deskbar. Add optional support for evolution/beagle with --enable arguments
	* Unify strings for browsers, use generic terms instead of applications names, all this is more user-friendly. Add a new string in applet.py
	* The glorious return of evolution addressbook handler. Fixed little bugs and threading issues in glue code, implemented the handler itself, and enjoy.
	* Add the Google Live Async handler, it has a little more requirements than other plugins and as such an UI to see error messages will be introduced, in the meantime it prints help file on stdout in the terminal, when an error occurs because of misconfiguration
	* Mess around with The Big Sucking Python Lock, hopefully fixes all the problems in the world, universe, and everything
	* Add timeout support for threaded async handlers
	* GNOME HIG changes: fix typo; fix border width; rephrase and move handler comment; fix a broken mnemonic.
	* Toggle sensitivity of the width label, spinner, and units when needed.
	* Add new files for translation, and use caracters instead of pixels for entry width
	* Handlers API rework, now a single file can have multiple handlers. HANDLER variable is exported containing the class name, and an info dictionary with name, description, and an optional requirements function, allowing to check if the handler can be loaded. As a side effect, browser handlers are now more fine grained, allowing to order independently bookmarks, history and search engines. The preference dialog is a bit bigger and has an extra blurb to hint the reordering prioritization.
	* Fix mozilla smart bookmarks parser
	* Add history parser for epiphany and galeon, in their respective handlers. Thanks to Crispin Flowerday <gnome@flowerday.cx>
	* More generic replacement of network places module, allows to open network places and various drives/volumes on the system
	* Fix the .desktop icon parsing
	* Preference dialog, it shows the avilable modules, and allow to enable/disable/sort the modules
	* Fixes bug #318869, add support for Galeon bookmarks.
	* Fixes macro `AM_CHECK_PYTHON_HEADERS' not found in library
	* Fixes bug #318720, mozilla smart bookmarks parser
	* Fix history menu, the item was always the first displayed. Fixes bug #318627
	* Fix case insensitive sorting
