deskbar-applet 2.23.2
=======================

In this release the get_tooltip method
has been added to the Action class.
Sub-classes can override this method

in a tooltip when the user hovers over its
description (this requires PyGTK >= 2.12).
In addition, beagle-live can now distinguish
between e-mails from thunderbird and evolution.

Changes:

    * Show tooltip when hovering over the arrow if more than one action is available.
    * Added get_tooltip method to Action interface. Override this method to display a tooltip when the user hovers over the match (the default action's tooltip is displayed) or over an action in the list of additional actions.
    * Fixed bug #522585: Crash when changing default browser
    * Added support for iceweasel browser. When the default browser is changed mozilla and iceweasel are supported, too. When Firefox is used and the command must contain firefox	instead of being exactly	firefox

=======================
deskbar-applet 2.21.90
=======================

Most notable, this release contains the Button UI that was already
part of Deskbar-Applet before 2.20. When you use this UI the results
will be attached to the panel where you added the applet.
In addition, Deskbar-Applet now recognizes when you change your peferred
browser and activates the appropriate modules for you. E.g. when
you were using Web History and Web Bookmarks for Mozilla before
changing the preferred browser to Epiphany, Web History and Web Bookmarks
for Epiphany will be enabled and the Mozilla modules disabled.
Last but not least, when beagle returns more than 20 results a match
will appear that opens beagle-search to display all available results.

Changes:
    * Re-Introduced the old Button UI. (work partly by Andreas Kühntopf)
    * Fixed bug #509126: Show hint that more beagle results are available (patch by JcRazo)
    * Fixed bug #452205: Deskbar does not notice when preferred browser changed for web searches (patch by aantny)
    * Added section about installing modules to documentation. (thanks to Qing Gan)

======================
deskbar-applet 2.15.90
======================

Changes:
        * Now checks for the elementtree Python package (as needed by the NewStuffManager).
        * Add a check in ModuleLoader.initialize_module(context) to see if we meet the any
          given requirements for the module before initializing. This should clean up a few
          exceptions on start-up. In Beagle-Live properly check if beagled is running via
          beagle.beagle_util_daemon_is_running(). If beagled is not running display an
          option to start it (via a standard "more" button in the module list view).

=====================
deskbar-applet 2.15.4
=====================

Changes:
	* Add preference to paste seection when triggering hotkey (work in progress)
	* Fix epiphany parsing of non-latin1 hrefs in bookmarks
	* Tweak sorting of program handlers
	* Correctly handle uri and identifier by not escaping them
	* Highlight search string in beagle imlogviewer
	* Add g-p-m and g-screensaver support in gdmactions.
	* Add gdmactions handler
	* Remove nesting for matches
	* Correctly detect mozilla profile. Patch by Jonathan Doda <jdodo@sympatico.ca>
	* Add a gconf key to set delay between writing something in search entry and performing the search.
	* Fix #346760: "Text in text entry from previous use is not highlighted when entry is brought up".
	* Patch by Travis B. Hartwell <nafai@travishartwell.net> for bug #346813 – "All handlers don't explicitly import deskbar.Match".
	* Keep the window above others when /apps/metacity/general/disable_workarounds is False. (it only worked for True).
	* Add window mode. You can launch it with -p or --popup. You need to regenerate deskbar/deskbar-applet. This work is mostly due to Sebastian Pölsterl. Things that obviously needs fixing: - Cannot gain focus on shortcut after first show. - UI polish.
	* Fix middle-click paste.
	* Do proper popup positioning when the gconf key /apps/metacity/general/disable_workarounds is TRUE. This required setting the gtk.gdk.WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_MENU on the popup. This fixes bug #335243. Re-enable + and ' for expand collapse in the tree. Only recalculate the popup postion when the window is hidden, and don't update_position() on resize events in CuemiacAlignedWindow (see fixme on line 34). Make the history popup of the button ui behave as a normal popup with regards to focus loss. Normal result popup is still toggle-style.
	* Make popup sticky in button mode. This closes #333371. This can easily be backported to 2.14. We just need to call gtk.Window.stick() and gtk.Window.unstick() just before we show/hide the popup.
	* Introduce CuemiacHeader and make button ui use it. Basically it is just a colored frame around the search entry.
	* SignallingHandler did not remove the gobject source on stop_query(). It does now. This should close #344049 and #344045. Make sure entriac emits a "stop-query" when the popup is hidden. CuemiacUIManager did not set proper path and column for the "row-acivated" signal on the treeview, in on_entry_activated, this caused trouble for the LingeringSelection. Fix this.
	* Make CuemiacHistory.CuemiacHistoryPopup use xgrab logic for focus handling. Let CuemiacEntryUI use this new history popup. NOTE: Keyboard navigation is broken in the history popup. This is related to the old #326254 bug. I think we have to add a a keyboard navigation model our selves as we did for CuemiacTreeView. Rip focus logic out of CuemiacUIManager and CuemiacLayoutProvider - it was broken and no widgets where using it anyway. Remove realization of the view from CuemiacPopupEntry.popup().

=====================
deskbar-applet 2.15.3
=====================

Changes:
	* Fix CuemiacPopupEntry navigation with an evil hack. The hack is encapsulated in the method CuemiacTreeView.move_cursor_up_down. Loads of general polish to the cuemiac stack. I think the history popup is still broken a bit. I plan to make it use some xgrab magic (like the popupentry). Don't popup a lingering selection when we activate something that has children in the treeview.
	* Introduction of the plugin updater/downloader, so it will be possible to update and download new plugins from internet, right in deskbar. Current commit includes build system patches (with dbus dependency, if someone can't build because of that, it can be made optional, but no updater) Also included is first raw patch for updates to work in the preference panel. The plugin updater is generic and can be hopefully made useful in some ways for other applications using python or non-compiled files, like gedit, rhythmbox, epiphany, gnumeric, the theme/icons/metacity dialog, etc
	* Moved web-repository to the official website repository, added testing modules to the remote repository. Allow the downloader to handle compressed tarballs as well as single-file python scripts. 
	* There is a second tab presenting available handlers that you don't have already installed, you can choose one of them, and install it. It will be downloaded and unpacked in the deskbar user directory. Normally every action should require no restart or anything, the buttons should be sensitive when possible, the plugins should be unloaded/reloaded without problems, etc. Anything else is a big. This needs heavy love, and probably an UI discussion..
	* WARNING: Breakage introduced as agreed on IRC. Mainly in entriac ui. Merge the Cuemiac rework. Highlights: - Introduce a CuemiacUIManager to handle the common tasks for uis using the C. - Introduce a CuemiacLayoutProvider abstract class to provide hooks for the common layout tasks. - Introductory work on a CuemiacPopupEntry in the style of gtk.EntryCompletion, problems in the navigational model relating to bug #326254 breaks entriac ui. - Add a LingeringSelectionWindow that leaves a "shadow" behind when a match is selected. See fixme in CuemiacTreeView.__on_button_press.
	* Add a hidden gconf setting to set the minimal number of chars to type before deskbar starts to react. Defaults to 1 as previsouly used. Patch by Maxime Henrion <mux@FreeBSD.org>
	* Import the gdmclient module from gimmie. It will be used for the shutdown/restart actions handler
	* Fix the hashing of programs so they won't show pathprograms and programs duplicate

deskbar-applet 2.13.92
======================

Changes:
	* Fixes bug #332418, now we use Icons instead of buttons in the panel reducing the needed panel vertical space
	* Don't import beagle each time we need it. Only when loading the module. This wastly increases beagle-live performance.
	* Fixes the applet not remembering 'take all available space on panel' setting on startup

======================
deskbar-applet 2.13.90
======================

Note: For some unknown reasons, it is not possible to focus the new UI with the
keybinding in gnome 2.12's panel. Help is appreciated.

Changes:
	* Bump to 2.13.90 to match gnome version

	* Change keyboard shortcuts triggering terminal or smart bookmarks to use Alt instead of Ctrl.
	* beagle-live tries to use text snippets when available
	* Categories are sorted according to the highest handler priority (as defined in the preferences) found in a match within the category. Matches insides a category are sorted according to their handler preference then relative priority. Finally alphabetic order is used.
	* Remember collapsed categories in the cuemiac UI	
	* Add proxy detection code in google-live
	* More stock icons, so we get theming
	* New Artwork
	* History handler, previously hardcoded is now a regular handler (old commands appear as matches)

====================
deskbar-applet 0.8.6
====================

Changes:
	* Remove our own beagle python binding. This mean we require beagle 0.1.3 that ships with python bindings.
	* New tango-ish artwork (because we're hype)
	* Fix history behavior. Duplicate items in history are moved instead of being added multiple times. Fixes bug #322981: Duplicate items in history
	* Builtin history completion as a regular match. 
	* Web search bookmarks (aka "smart bookmarks") can now have shortcuts (aka "keywords") and keyboard shortcuts.
	* Tidied up the preferences dialog. 
	* Disabled handlers are now sorted by name alphabetically in the Preferences UI.
	* Scale down those icons that are too large.
	* Evolution handler is now sync rather than async. This will hopefully fix evolution handler bugs like bug #322119.
	* Fixed crasher when user has more than one address book available for auto-completion. Possibly fixes bug #321975.
	* 'Smart' history browsing, now it's possible to use shell-like up/down key to browse history, yet preserving (page) up/down navigation in the matches list.

====================

Changes:
	* Fix bug #321236: always show file search and gnome dict even when the menu item is hidden by the user.

	* Add wrapper for lignome-dektop's GnomeDesktopItem to parse .desktop files
	* Startup Notification support.
	* New Duplication detection, duplicate items are checked in the order defined by handler priorities.

Deskbar Applet 0.8.1 -- The eye of Sauron is moving
====================

Changes:
	* Some more beagle fixes, and release 0.8.1
	* More beagle properties fixtures
	* Fix the sender of the mails being None all the time

====================
Deskbar Applet 0.8.0 --  No, it's not /written/ in C!
====================

Changes:
	* Improve the regexes for mail and location detection. It is now possible to have user@host but with the method specified, otherwise it's an email address. Add package config file to allow third parties to install handlers in the right place.
	* Add gnomevfs monitoring for module loader. That means drag and dropped handlers in the user or system handlers directory will be loaded, and automagically show in the prefs dialog, unenabled by default. We do not do anything on modification, because it would only be useful for developpers, and then developpers don't want handlers to autoupdate.
	* Add gnomevfs file monitoring to handlers that need it. Epiphany, Galeon, mozilla now reload on bookmark, history, search engines addition/removal. The gtkBookmarks are also reloaded when needed. Other handlers do not need this functionality
	* Speed-up the loading of the module by not loading the list of executables. Executables are instead "probed" at each query. Side effect, is that we don't need to reindex the $PATH when a new program is installed
	* Fix the previous fix to pass distcheck. Allow to use a development deskbar-applet with its own set of enabled handlers and priority, to not interfere with stable one. (Useful only for developpers)
	* Change the location of deskbar-applet launcher script, using /usr/libexec is deprecated. Fixes bug #319354
	* Cleanup the way we use icons. Whenever possible, use stock icons, removed duplicate icons we shipped in the tarball.
	* Add libbeagle python binding, and the associated beagle-live.py handler allowing to search with beagle from within deskbar. Add optional support for evolution/beagle with --enable arguments
	* Unify strings for browsers, use generic terms instead of applications names, all this is more user-friendly. Add a new string in applet.py
	* The glorious return of evolution addressbook handler. Fixed little bugs and threading issues in glue code, implemented the handler itself, and enjoy.
	* Add the Google Live Async handler, it has a little more requirements than other plugins and as such an UI to see error messages will be introduced, in the meantime it prints help file on stdout in the terminal, when an error occurs because of misconfiguration
	* Mess around with The Big Sucking Python Lock, hopefully fixes all the problems in the world, universe, and everything
	* Add timeout support for threaded async handlers
	* GNOME HIG changes: fix typo; fix border width; rephrase and move handler comment; fix a broken mnemonic.
	* Toggle sensitivity of the width label, spinner, and units when needed.
	* Add new files for translation, and use caracters instead of pixels for entry width
	* Handlers API rework, now a single file can have multiple handlers. HANDLER variable is exported containing the class name, and an info dictionary with name, description, and an optional requirements function, allowing to check if the handler can be loaded. As a side effect, browser handlers are now more fine grained, allowing to order independently bookmarks, history and search engines. The preference dialog is a bit bigger and has an extra blurb to hint the reordering prioritization.
	* Fix mozilla smart bookmarks parser
	* Add history parser for epiphany and galeon, in their respective handlers. Thanks to Crispin Flowerday <gnome@flowerday.cx>
	* More generic replacement of network places module, allows to open network places and various drives/volumes on the system
	* Fix the .desktop icon parsing
	* Preference dialog, it shows the avilable modules, and allow to enable/disable/sort the modules
	* Fixes bug #318869, add support for Galeon bookmarks.
	* Fixes macro `AM_CHECK_PYTHON_HEADERS' not found in library
	* Fixes bug #318720, mozilla smart bookmarks parser
	* Fix history menu, the item was always the first displayed. Fixes bug #318627
	* Fix case insensitive sorting
