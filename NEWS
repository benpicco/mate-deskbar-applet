====================
deskbar-applet 0.8.6
====================

Changes:
	* Remove our own beagle python binding. This mean we require beagle 0.1.3 that ships with python bindings.
	* New tango-ish artwork (because we're hype)
	* Fix history behavior. Duplicate items in history are moved instead of being added multiple times. Fixes bug #322981: Duplicate items in history
	* Builtin history completion as a regular match. 
	* Web search bookmarks (aka "smart bookmarks") can now have shortcuts (aka "keywords") and keyboard shortcuts.
	* Tidied up the preferences dialog. 
	* Disabled handlers are now sorted by name alphabetically in the Preferences UI.
	* Scale down those icons that are too large.
	* Evolution handler is now sync rather than async. This will hopefully fix evolution handler bugs like bug #322119.
	* Fixed crasher when user has more than one address book available for auto-completion. Possibly fixes bug #321975.
	* 'Smart' history browsing, now it's possible to use shell-like up/down key to browse history, yet preserving (page) up/down navigation in the matches list.

====================

Changes:
	* Fix bug #321236: always show file search and gnome dict even when the menu item is hidden by the user.

====================
Deskbar Applet 0.8.0 --  No, it's not /written/ in C!
====================

Changes:
	* Improve the regexes for mail and location detection. It is now possible to have user@host but with the method specified, otherwise it's an email address. Add package config file to allow third parties to install handlers in the right place.
	* Add gnomevfs monitoring for module loader. That means drag and dropped handlers in the user or system handlers directory will be loaded, and automagically show in the prefs dialog, unenabled by default. We do not do anything on modification, because it would only be useful for developpers, and then developpers don't want handlers to autoupdate.
	* Add gnomevfs file monitoring to handlers that need it. Epiphany, Galeon, mozilla now reload on bookmark, history, search engines addition/removal. The gtkBookmarks are also reloaded when needed. Other handlers do not need this functionality
	* Speed-up the loading of the module by not loading the list of executables. Executables are instead "probed" at each query. Side effect, is that we don't need to reindex the $PATH when a new program is installed
	* Fix the previous fix to pass distcheck. Allow to use a development deskbar-applet with its own set of enabled handlers and priority, to not interfere with stable one. (Useful only for developpers)
	* Change the location of deskbar-applet launcher script, using /usr/libexec is deprecated. Fixes bug #319354
	* Cleanup the way we use icons. Whenever possible, use stock icons, removed duplicate icons we shipped in the tarball.
	* Add libbeagle python binding, and the associated beagle-live.py handler allowing to search with beagle from within deskbar. Add optional support for evolution/beagle with --enable arguments
	* Unify strings for browsers, use generic terms instead of applications names, all this is more user-friendly. Add a new string in applet.py
	* The glorious return of evolution addressbook handler. Fixed little bugs and threading issues in glue code, implemented the handler itself, and enjoy.
	* Add the Google Live Async handler, it has a little more requirements than other plugins and as such an UI to see error messages will be introduced, in the meantime it prints help file on stdout in the terminal, when an error occurs because of misconfiguration
	* Mess around with The Big Sucking Python Lock, hopefully fixes all the problems in the world, universe, and everything
	* Add timeout support for threaded async handlers
	* GNOME HIG changes: fix typo; fix border width; rephrase and move handler comment; fix a broken mnemonic.
	* Toggle sensitivity of the width label, spinner, and units when needed.
	* Add new files for translation, and use caracters instead of pixels for entry width
	* Handlers API rework, now a single file can have multiple handlers. HANDLER variable is exported containing the class name, and an info dictionary with name, description, and an optional requirements function, allowing to check if the handler can be loaded. As a side effect, browser handlers are now more fine grained, allowing to order independently bookmarks, history and search engines. The preference dialog is a bit bigger and has an extra blurb to hint the reordering prioritization.
	* Fix mozilla smart bookmarks parser
	* Add history parser for epiphany and galeon, in their respective handlers. Thanks to Crispin Flowerday <gnome@flowerday.cx>
	* More generic replacement of network places module, allows to open network places and various drives/volumes on the system
	* Fix the .desktop icon parsing
	* Preference dialog, it shows the avilable modules, and allow to enable/disable/sort the modules
	* Fixes bug #318869, add support for Galeon bookmarks.
	* Fixes macro `AM_CHECK_PYTHON_HEADERS' not found in library
	* Fixes bug #318720, mozilla smart bookmarks parser
	* Fix history menu, the item was always the first displayed. Fixes bug #318627
	* Fix case insensitive sorting
