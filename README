Execute the following steps to install deskbar-applet

./configure

Now you can either install it on your system:

Known issues
=============
Address Book searches don't work.  I'm waiting for Python bindings for
galago.  For those who watched the screencast, they were just
a mock-up.  Sorry.  Everything else should work, though.  :)
