Known issues
=============
* When using mate-python-extras-2.10, you will be able to use deskbar-applet only in window-mode, not in the panel, because you won't be able to focus and type in it.

=============
Installation
=============
Execute the following steps to install deskbar-applet

./configure --prefix /usr
make

Now you can either install it on your system:

Then you are able to add the applet through the mate-panel applet manager.

Or you can try it without installation, by running
./deskbar/deskbar-applet -w
