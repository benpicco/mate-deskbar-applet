================================================================================
== Buzzwords-laden Overview ==
The deskbar is an applet a little like the mini-commander: An entry where
you can type queries. While you type, these words are then passed to a
list of pluggable backends which produce results, shown in a list.
Selecting a result with the keyboard or mouse triggers the associated action.

We offer a broad range of builtin backends, see the section Features here under.

Deskbar by itself could improve the experience of the alt-f2 dialog
and mini-commander, instead of proposing only programs, you could have
all the power of the backends at your fingertips.


== Features ==
Generic:
 * Sits in the panel waiting for input
 * Global configurable hotkey to directly focus the entry and start typing
 * Pluggable backend architecture, allows to add custom backends in home/system dir. Allows third parties to add a backend, ie. tomboy can add a tomboy backend by installing a python script in a specified folder.
 * Sorting of backend results order is adaptable easily.
 * Ability to choose a fixed width or to expand in the panel to fill all available room
 * Intuitive history menu, to repeat frequent actions
 * Fully i18n-ed
 * Use themed icons associated with actions, to have a visual feedback

Backends:
 * Simple API for backends implementors, either blocking or non-blocking.
 * Simple static backends like 'Search xx with yy' where yy can be beagle, gnome-dict, gnome-search-tool,..
 * Index .desktop files in english and locale, and allow to launch a program by typing some descriptive words, for example typing 'text' returns gedit, gvim, ... but you can also type 'editeur' in french and get the same results.
 * Launch command line applications with any arguments: 'killall evolution', 'sitecopy -uo mysite'
 * Open directories/files by typing a full path, or relative to home dir
 * Open nautilus bookmarks and computer volumes (with network places) by name
 * Send mail by typing an email address, open a webpage by typing an address
 * With evolution-data-server, type an name or address and send mails to your addressbook contacts
 * With libbeagle, show a small selection of beagle result for typed word
 * Perform google queries with typed word, and show the results in the list
 * Browser integration (epiphany, galeon, and mozilla/firefox): index the bookmarks title and url, also index the history, and smart bookmarks/search engines.
 * Gnomevfs monitoring where applicable:
  * dynamic handler installation with drag and drop, reload on modification
  * watch indexed files to detect changes, like new program installation, or new bookmarks
 * Pkg-config file to allow apps to easily install handlers to system location

== Planned Features ==
 * UI Rework to have a better suited widget than a flat list out of CompletionPopup, in progress
 * Mozilla/Firefox history indexation
 * When ready, python bindings for galago, allowing integration with gaim contacts
 * Thunderbird addressbook, similar to evolution support
 * When framework is complete, support for recently used files
 
== Requirements ==
Required dependencies:
 * Python 2.3 or above
 * pygtk-2.6 (modules: gtk, gtk.gdk, gtk.glade, gobject)
 * gnome-python-2.10 (modules: gconf, gnome, gnome.ui, gnomevfs)
 * gnome-python-extras-2.10 (module: gnomeapplet)
 * gtk+-2.6 to compile global hotkey and icon entry

Optional dependencies:
 * Compile time:
  * evolution-data-server-1.2, for libebook-1.2
  * beagle-1.1, python bindings for libbeagle, currently shipped, and on their way upstream
 * Run time:
  * Running beagle daemon
  * Running evolution-data-server
  * SOAPpy package to search with google soap API

Installation
=============
Execute the following steps to install deskbar-applet

./configure --prefix /usr
make

Now you can either install it on your system:
sudo make install (or run make install as root)

Then you are able to add the applet through the gnome-panel applet manager.

Or you can try it without installation, by running
./deskbar/deskbar-applet -w
