Requirements
=============
You will need the following packages to build and run the deskbar applet:
 * GTK and PyGTK 2.8
 * Python 2.3
 * libsexy/pysexy which are not released yet, you must use the SVN repository:
   (and check their README files for how to install):
      svn co http://osiris.chipx86.com/svn/osiris-misc/trunk/libsexy/
      svn co http://osiris.chipx86.com/svn/osiris-misc/trunk/pysexy/

Installation
=============
Execute the following steps to install deskbar-applet

./configure
make

Now you can either install it on your system:
sudo make install (or run make install as root)

Then you are able to add the applet through the gnome-panel applet manager.

Or you can try it without installation, by running
./deskbar/deskbar-applet -w

=============
Known issues
=============
Address Book searches don't work.  I'm waiting for Python bindings for
galago.  For those who watched the screencast, they were just
a mock-up.  Sorry.  Everything else should work, though.  :)
