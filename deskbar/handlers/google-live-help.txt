Deskbar Applet - Google Live Help File                2005-10-17
================================================================

You need a Google account to make use of Google Live querying in
the Deskbar Applet. To create one go to http://api.google.com.

When you have create your account you should recieve a Google
API key by mail. Place the key in the file

~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/Google.key

If you do not recieve an API key (or you have lost it) in your account 
verification mail go to www.google.com/accounts and log in. Then go to 
api.google.com and click "Create Account" and resubmit your mail address 
and password. This will regenerate your API key and send it to you.

Now download the developers kit and extract the GoogleSearch.wsdl
file from it. Copy this file to

~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/GoogleSearch.wsdl

When you have done this, restart the deskbar applet (remove it from the
panel and add it again, or just log out and log back in). In the restarted
deskbar applet go to the preferences and enable Google Live.

Enjoy,
