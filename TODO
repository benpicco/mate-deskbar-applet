Indexer:
* Use Pyndex or Lupy, which are full text indexing engines in python.
  - Since we aren't indexing many things, speed is not very important.
  - See if it proves better than the current token-based indexer.
  - Provides on-disk caching which may be useful
  
Backends TODOs:
	General:
	* Pluggable backends ? scan ~/gnome2/deskbar-applet/*.py and /usr/lib/blah 
	  for subclasses of Handler  and add them to handlers list
	* Use a thread to init the various handlers ?
	
	
	Browsers (ephy, ff, moz): [epiphany.py, mozilla.py]
	* Use smart bookmarks inside the search bar (eg. google smart bookmark
	  performs a search on google for typed word) for Mozilla+FF
	* Monitor changes with gnome vfs
	
	Addres Book + Gaim contacts: [galago.py,Dummy implementation, waiting for python bindings]
	* Use galago instead of custom parsing (python bindings are coming)
	* Index contact email, names
	* Allow Send IM to: and Send email to:
	
	File-system: (provide way to open file/dirs) [filesystem.py]
	* ?
	
	Gtk Bookmarks [gtkbookmarks.py]
	* Retreive stored remote locations, like the "Places" menu items
	* Monitor changes with gnome vfs
	
	Programs [programs.py]
	* Currently we provide special special functions for certain specific programs
	  eg. gnome-dict, gnome-search tool, is that good, how to do it better..
	* Maybe maintain a cache of /usr/bin:$PATH files instead of rescanning each startup
	* Use localized comments and program title in .deskto files
	* Monitor changes with gnome vfs
	
	Recently-used files [todo]
	* Index and present
	* Monitor changes with gnome vfs
		
	Beagle [todo]
	* We should also pass the string to beagle via some library (libbeagle or similar)
	  and show the first matching results in the dropdown
	
	Misc

What happens when text is typed in the entry:
	* We have a list of backends, each backend is queried for the string.
	* The backend retun a list of matches objects
	??: A backend can stop the chaining if he thinks no other backend can use the text (ie. paths)
	??: Priority system ?
	The backends should have a priority:
		Launch program for exact match
		Launch program for description match
		Send mail & IM
		Bookmarks
		Web Search
		Beagle
		Path
	
Proposed API for backends:
See handler.py for the base classes to subclass for new backends
