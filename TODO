Merge f&f and f&f-bookmarks ?
--------------
More categories
------------------

Release dependant:

- Make the pref dialog non modal ?? i tried but it doesn't work.. ?
- (TRIVIAL) Adjust max hits per handler (especially beagle-live should return a skazillion hits)

Would be really really nice:
- (MEDIUM) Show nests only for two or more nested results, or something like that
- (MEDIUM) User defined (non-static) categories *WITHOUT PERFOMANCE HIT*
- (?) Optimize memory and speed
- (?) Multiscreen logic.
- (EASY) Fine tune aligned window behavior for vertical panels
 Should probably check the window.gravity and construct the popup window according to that;
 - ie. entry at bottom, hits on top, for applets in lower half of the screen, and vice versa
 for applets in the top half (this can be read frm the CuemiacAlignedWindow.gravity).


Bonus features/Ideas
- (HARD) Detach the search window to "save" the search
- (MEDIUM) Drag hits onto desktop/nautilus to create links (likely to require additional Match api)
- Go into shortcur mode when alt is pressed (with entry focus) and show flat list of avail
 shortcuts. When match list is focussed bind shortcuts when user hits ctrl-*.

Warn when keybinding fails

Keyboard/Keyword shortcut framework:
	* Smart bookmarks: ctrl+letter => search with xxx(letter) for text
	* Directories/files/places/volumes ctrl+letter => open
		dynamic registration when loaded, "static" matches
		
	* Path programs: ctrl+t => execute text in terminal
		static registration from handler
	
	* All: ctrl+letter => action on bookmarked match
		Used with the P.

Ideas from the Net:
	* Tab completions, where applicable, if it doesn't clash with usability

UI TODOs:
	* Translucency handling in applet mode, see mini-commander patch in bugzilla

* Cache/Pickle indexes
* Move indexing in a bonobo factory whatever that means
* Hidden gconf key for alt-f2 dialog replacement

Backends TODOs:
	General:
			
	Browsers (ephy, ff, moz): [epiphany.py, mozilla.py]
	* Use Mozilla/FF's history file to present history items
	
	Address Books [evolution.py]
	* Index Thunderbird address book

	Programs [programs.py, pathprograms.py]
	* Monitor changes with gnome vfs
	
	Beagle [beagle.py, beagle-live.py]
	* Use beagle to retreive metadata about files, for example in recent-files ?
			
	Recently-used files [todo]
	* Index and present
	* Wait until 2.14 bug code refactoring upstream
	* Monitor changes with gnome vfs	
	
	Gaim contacts: [galago.py]
	* Use galago instead of custom parsing (python bindings are coming)
	* Allow Send IM to: and Send email to:
	
	File-system: (provide way to open file/dirs) [filesystem.py]
	
	Gtk Bookmarks [gtkbookmarks.py]
	
	Web Address, Email Address: [web_address.py, email_address.py]:
	
	Misc
