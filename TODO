Ideas from the Net:
	* Do a background google search and provide the first hits in the list.
	* Tab completions, where applicable, if it doesn't clash with usability

* Truncate strings in the completion view
* Reload handlers on change via gnomevfs ?

Indexer:
  - Provides on-disk caching which may be useful

Backends TODOs:
	General:
	* Do something about hardcoded path, for example /usr/share/applications
	* Remove uneccesary markup for i18n
	* Some icons (.desktop one notably) do not scale down, that's ugly
	* Launch & show a CLI program in a window (output/err)
	* Pkg-config for ext handlers
	
	Web Address, Email Address: [web_address.py, email_address.py]:
	* Change regex for URI, currently it doesn't allow user@host
		
	Browsers (ephy, ff, moz): [epiphany.py, mozilla.py]
	* Use Mozilla/FF's history file to present history items
	* Monitor changes with gnome vfs
	* 'Search "Search Google" for key', is no good grammar, find something..
	
	Address Book + Gaim contacts: [galago.py,Dummy implementation, waiting for python bindings]
	* Use galago instead of custom parsing (python bindings are coming)
	* Index contact email, names
	* Allow Send IM to: and Send email to:
	* Index Thunderbird address book, see evolution-sharp for possible evo-data-server python bindings
	* Galago works only for gaim ?!

	File-system: (provide way to open file/dirs) [filesystem.py]
	* ?
	
	Gtk Bookmarks [gtkbookmarks.py]
	* Monitor changes with gnome vfs
	
	Programs [programs.py]
	* Currently we provide special special functions for certain specific programs
	  eg. gnome-dict, gnome-search tool, is that good, how to do it better..
	* Do not show items not in menu or removed by user
	* Monitor changes with gnome vfs
	
	Recently-used files [todo]
	* Index and present
	* Wait until 2.14 bug code refactoring upstream
	* Monitor changes with gnome vfs
		
	Beagle [todo]
	* We should also pass the string to beagle via some library (libbeagle or similar)
	  and show the first matching results in the dropdown
	* Use beagle to retreive metadata about files, for example in recent-files ?
	
	Misc
	* Put some hardwired backends if really needed.
