Ideas from the Net:
	* Tab completions, where applicable, if it doesn't clash with usability

UI TODOs:
	* Truncate strings in the completion view
	* Enable drag-n-drop along with cuemiac, for example dragging file hits to desktop/nautilus
	* An UI for errors/infos happening during module load/init
	
Backends TODOs:
	General:
